    <p>
    Right now, I've just finished episode 5 of Umineko. Slowly, it teases out more clues, but I still feel like I have only islands of speculation for any of these first five episodes. I want to write down what I know, believe or suspect, for myself later on, and for those friends who have already read further and may be entertained to hear my struggles. <span class=red-truth>The following will contain spoilers.</span> Leave now if you do not want to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
    Don't share this just yet, it's not quite finished. I want to settle it before I start episode 6.
    </p>

    <br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Universal truths</h2>

    <p>In episode 4, we are told, <span class=red-truth>"No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight. No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!"</span> This is later used as evidence for Battler's status, when in episode 5 he reports that he thought he saw Kinzo. Since nobody could make this mistake, we are told he must must be lying, and somehow this conflicts with Knox's rules about the detective presenting all clues they discover to the reader.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I don't entirely understand this. I don't see which of Knox's rules prevent the detective from lying. If they find clues they have to present them, but that doesn't seem enough to prevent them from lying about something that didn't happen, however much that might make for an unsatisfying story.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, this shows that <span class=blue-truth>at least some red truths apply beyond the episode in which they were presented!</span> How are we to discern which those are?</p>

    <p>Perhaps <span class=blue-truth>all red truths are universal.</span> That is, they apply regardless of episode. But this idea falls apart when we find statements that are clearly contradictory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Episode 2: <span class=red-truth>When Jessica's corpse was discovered, only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were in Jessica's room.</span></li>
        <li>Episode 3: <span class=red-truth>Those 15 are all dead. Battler is alive. Eva is alive. Jessica is alive.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are clearly specific to their own episodes. It's not possible for all these people to be present for Jessica's corpse being discovered but also to all be dead while Jessica is still alive.</p>

    <p>So let's set aside those truths that appear to be specific to a time or place. <span class=blue-truth>Any red truth that speaks in generalities is universal, and remains true in all episodes.</span> What truths might these be? Scouring through the first four episodes, here are some candidates. Do these sound plausible?</p>

    <ul>

        <li class=red-truth>Only one key to the chapel exists!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with any thing but the chapel's key!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>You are incompetent!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There are only five master keys.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>I keep my promises.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you should be able to reach the Golden Land. When you do, the ceremony will end. No more people will die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Ushiromiya Battler has a sin.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Because of your sin, people die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Due to your sin, a great many humans of this island die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No one escapes, all die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>You can't trust anything, you can't trust any words that aren't red...!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of all four games.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games! However, this means that you can take one person out!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No more than 17 humans exist on this island!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There were no doors with auto-locks other than Kinzo's study!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No one else can go by Kanon's name!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>A different person can't claim that as their name!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of these seem pretty reasonable, perhaps we even already interpreted these as being universal. I can't see anything in any of the others that's obviously got some application elsewhere, though I will be happy if we can find a use for "you are incompetent".</p>

    <h2>A true scenario</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>There is a single true scenario.</span> This may or may not be one of the eight scenarios described in the story. </li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>There is a true scenario compatible with all red truths.</span> Okay, for the same reasons as given above, that one's probably already been cut down by the red truths.</li>
        <li><span class=blue-true>The events we see attest <em>something</em> about the true scenario, but perhaps only symbolically. When elements occur repeatedly, we consider them all to be shadows cast by a single true event. For example, a murder took place in a room locked with a chain on the door, and somebody had to bring wire-cutters from the boiler room to cut the chain.</span></li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>All red truths not specific to a time or place are universal.</span> That is, they hold true across all episodes and in any hypothetical "true scenario".</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applying Knox's first</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>We have seen Natsuhi's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Natsuhi is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Battler's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Battler is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Rosa's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Rosa is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Maria's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Maria is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Shannon's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Shannon is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Eva's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Eva is not the killer?!?</span> But this is ridiculous.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Observations and theories</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>Gohda served Maria's rose as dessert during lunch.</span> This rhymes, doesn't it? Think about Rosa being forced to eat her siblings in episode 2's tea party. Also, is there perhaps a link between keys and flowers? Maria is upset about her lost flower in a very similar way to when she is upset about her lost key in episode 4.</li>
        <li>We see a mirror in a small shrine on a reef in sight of Rokkenjima and Niijima. We see a mirror in Natsuhi's room. <span class=blue-truth>There is only one mirror. Somebody took it and broke it.</span></li>
        <li>Battler broke a promise he made six years ago. Battler forgot someone six years ago. Somebody was heartbroken. "Both boys and girls... want to hear someone else say they love them first." There don't seem to be a lot of candidates, but six years ago Battler was 12 and Shannon was 10. [distant people like you quote? can't remember what I meant here...]</li>
        <li>Somebody plays Beatrice with Maria every year. They don't need to deceive Maria to achieve this because Maria is eager and willing to play along.</li>
        <li>Genji unlocks the guest-room that Eva and Hideyoshi died in. Then he instructs Kanon to find Kumasawa and a wire-cutter and says that he is going to find Natsuhi. <span class=blue-truth>Once the coast is clear, the killer was able to leave the room. By some means, such as by use of an adhesive or by earlier having half-cut one of the links, they then made it look like the chain is fastened.</span> "He then pressed with all of his strength, and cut through the chain <em>far more easily than he had imagined.</em> The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth..."</li>

    </ul>
