    <p>
    Right now, I've just finished episode 5 of Umineko. Slowly, it teases out more clues, but I still feel like I have only islands of speculation for any of these first five episodes. I want to write down what I know, believe or suspect, for myself later on, and for those friends who have already read further and may be entertained to hear my struggles. <span class=red-truth>The following will contain spoilers.</span> Leave now if you do not want to read them.
    </p>
    <p>
    This is pretty messy. There's no nice conclusion here. Just a bunch of rambling thoughts, disconnected hypotheses and unanswered questions. But at least it captures some of my thinking. Much of this line of thought, especially some of the stuff about Shannon comes from pulling on threads that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rrika9.bsky.social">Erika</a> started. I've definitely focused more on the murders of the first episode than any later here, largely because I only have so much energy and time. I just want to commit something to the page before I continue to read any further.
    </p>
    <p>This is the first in a sequence of such posts. I'll link them here when I add them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>This piece, written after reading episode 5.</li>
        <li>A second piece, written <a href="blog-umineko-2.html">while reading episode 6</a>.</li>
        <li>A third, written <a href="blog-umineko-3.html">after finishing episode 6</a>.</li>
        <li>A fourth, written <a href="blog-umineko-4.html">a short way into episode 8</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Universal truths</h2>

    <p>In episode 4, we are told, <span class=red-truth>"No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight. No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!"</span> This is later used as evidence for Battler's status, when in episode 5 he reports that he thought he saw Kinzo. Since nobody could make this mistake, we are told he must must be lying, and somehow this conflicts with Knox's rules about the detective presenting all clues they discover to the reader.</p>

    <p>Honestly, I don't <em>entirely</em> understand this. I don't see which of Knox's rules prevent the detective from lying. If they find clues they have to present them, but that doesn't seem enough to prevent them from lying about something that didn't happen, however much that might make for an unsatisfying story.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, this shows that <span class=blue-truth>at least some red truths apply beyond the episode in which they were presented!</span> How are we to discern which those are?</p>

    <p>Perhaps <span class=blue-truth>all red truths are universal.</span> That is, they apply regardless of episode. But this idea falls apart when we find statements that are clearly contradictory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Episode 2: <span class=red-truth>When Jessica's corpse was discovered, only Battler, George, Maria, Rosa, Genji, Gohda, Shannon, Kumasawa, and Nanjo were in Jessica's room.</span></li>
        <li>Episode 3: <span class=red-truth>Those 15 are all dead. Battler is alive. Eva is alive. Jessica is alive.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>These are clearly specific to their own episodes. It's not possible for all these people to be present for Jessica's corpse being discovered but also to all be dead while Jessica is still alive.</p>

    <p>So let's set aside those truths that appear to be specific to a time or place. <span class=blue-truth>Any red truth that speaks in generalities is universal, and remains true in all episodes.</span> What truths might these be? Scouring through the first four episodes, here are some candidates. Do these sound plausible?</p>

    <ul>

        <li class=red-truth>Only one key to the chapel exists!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>It is impossible to unlock the lock to the chapel with any thing but the chapel's key!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>When the door to the chapel is locked, it prevents any and all methods of entry or exit!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>The only master keys are the ones held by the servants, one key each.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>You are incompetent!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There are only five master keys.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>I keep my promises.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>If you solve the riddle of the epitaph, you should be able to reach the Golden Land. When you do, the ceremony will end. No more people will die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Of all of the doors that exist on Rokkenjima, none has a crack through which a key can slip.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>A hidden mansion called Kuwadorian does exist in the forest of Rokkenjima.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There are no more than 18 humans on this Rokkenjima!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>The sin I am now demanding that you remember is not between Ushiromiya Battler and Beatrice.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Ushiromiya Battler has a sin.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Because of your sin, people die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Due to your sin, a great many humans of this island die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No one escapes, all die.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>You can't trust anything, you can't trust any words that aren't red...!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No person would mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No matter what disguise might be used, they would not mistake Ushiromiya Kinzo by sight!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Kinzo's life or death status is the same at the start of all four games.</li>
        <li class=red-truth>Kinzo is already dead at the starting time for all games! However, this means that you can take one person out!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No more than 17 humans exist on this island!!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>There were no doors with auto-locks other than Kinzo's study!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>No one else can go by Kanon's name!</li>
        <li class=red-truth>A different person can't claim that as their name!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Most of these seem pretty reasonable, perhaps we even already interpreted these as being universal. I can't see anything in any of the others that's obviously got some application elsewhere, though I will be happy if we can find a use for "you are incompetent".</p>

    <h2>A true scenario</h2>

    <p>I think <span class=blue-truth>there is a single true scenario.</span> This may or may not be one of the eight scenarios described in the story. If this is true, I think it's either the first episode or none of them at all. The first episode exists in a more mysterious state due to the absence of any meta-game running alongside it. It also has the least intrusions from obviously fantastical elements, although we do have to doubt at least any scene where Kinzo appears or those participating in the Kinzo illusion are discussing anything about him. This all makes me more interested in the events of first episode than the others.</p>
    <p>Taking a step further, I might try to claim <span class=blue-truth>there is a true scenario compatible with all red truths.</span> But for the same reasons as given above, that seems rather doomed by the red truths about Jessica's death.</p>
    <p><span class=blue-true>The events we see attest <em>something</em> about the true scenario, but perhaps only symbolically. When elements occur repeatedly, we consider them all to be shadows cast by a single true event. For example, a murder took place in a room locked with a chain on the door, and somebody had to bring wire-cutters from the boiler room to cut the chain.</span></p>
    <p><span class=blue-truth>All red truths not specific to a time or place also apply to any "true" scenario.</span></p>

    <h2>Applying Knox's first</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>We have seen Natsuhi's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Natsuhi is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Battler's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Battler is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Rosa's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Rosa is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Maria's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Maria is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Shannon's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Shannon is not the killer.</span></li>
        <li>We have seen Eva's thoughts. <span class=blue-truth>Eva is not the killer?!?</span> But this is ridiculous. We saw her shoot Battler! But maybe we can still apply this logic to our hypothetical true scenario?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I feel like a lot of my meta-reasoning is based on the premise that the game isn't going to jerk us around. It would suck to invite us to solve a puzzle for 10 hours and then go "nevermind, that entire part was a red herring". So there must be some solution to explain each episode and each of the locked room puzzles. Each killing must have a killer, a motive and a mechanism that can be explained, for which clues have been provided.</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ The wheelbarrow</h2>
    <blockquote>"He seemed to be fine with the light-looking gardening tools, shovels and such, but he looked like he was having trouble getting his arms around and lifting up some sacks of fertilizer."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"Since Kanon-kun looked like he hadn't yet gone through his growth spurt, he was stuck with a sorta weak body."</blockquote>
    <p>This scene appears to be showing us that someone like Kanon is too feeble to lift a body on their own... but they could move one around with a wheelbarrow, if they could get the body into it in the first place.</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ Maria's rose</h2>
    <p><span class=blue-truth>Gohda served Maria's rose as dessert during lunch.</span> "The rose petals scattered across were selected just now from that rose garden." What does this mean? Nobody seemed to draw the connection a short time later when wondering what happened to Maria's rose, which seems conspicuous. Is this enough to be a motive? Kanon seems to have a lot of hatred for Gohda in this episode, but I can't spot any evidence Maria recognises what Gohda did. The rose had a rolled up candy wrapper tied around its stem, but I am unable to spot evidence that Gohda or anybody else had this wrapper.</p>
    <p>I do observe some rhyming later on. In episode 2's tea party, Rosa is forced to eat her siblings. Also, in a flashback in episode 4, Maria is upset about her lost key in a very similar way to how she gets upset about the rose. Are these aspects of the same event? Is there some equivalence between keys and flowers?</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ Rudolph's fear</h2>
    <p>Why did Rudolph say he might be killed?</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ Shannon's shift</h2>
    <p>The servants' shifts got rearranged a couple of times. Shannon appears to have asked Kumasawa to change the shifts, perhaps so she could see George. We are told Krauss changed the shifts to send the one-winged servants to the guesthouse. Ultimately Shannon returns to the mansion. It seems very possible that Shannon wasn't supposed to be in the mansion when the murders happened. Is it possible the killer(s) did not intend for her to die? For instance, Kanon seems very unlikely to have wanted her to die...</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ The chain on the door</h2>
    <p>Genji unlocks the guest-room that Eva and Hideyoshi died in. Then he instructs Kanon to find Kumasawa and a wire-cutter and says that he is going to find Natsuhi. <span class=blue-truth>Once the coast is clear, the killer â€“ or at least somebody hidden in the room â€“ was able to leave the room. By some means, such as by use of an adhesive or by earlier having half-cut one of the links, they then made it look like the chain is fastened.</span> "He then pressed with all of his strength, and cut through the chain <em>far more easily than he had imagined.</em> The cut chain fell into two separate parts, which continued to clang as they swayed back and forth..."</p>
    <p>Is this just luck or is Genji covering for the killer when he sends Kanon away?</p>
    <h2>Episode 1 â€“ Kanon's death</h2>
    <blockquote class=red-truth>"All of the survivors have alibis! Let us include the dead as well!! In short, no kind of human or dead person on the island could have killed Kanon!</blockquote>
    <blockquote class=red-truth>"Kanon did not commit suicide"</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"He grasped the handle of the weapon sticking into his chest with both hands, ......and gritting his teeth with an acute, unearthly pain, .....................he pulled it out."</blockquote>
    <p>Nobody ever observes the stake <em>in</em> Kanon's chest. We cannot trust this depiction of events. <span class=blue-truth>Kanon was not impaled with a stake.</span></p>
    <blockquote>"Natsuhi realized that even though Kanon was on the verge of death, he was still conscious, so she sent Genji to get the doctor."</blockquote>
    <blockquote>"In the end, Kanon-kun did not regain consciousness."</blockquote>
    <p>Did Kanon ever lose consciousness?</p>
    <blockquote>"......My sincere apologies. Without proper facilities, there was nothing I could do about such a serious wound..."</blockquote>
    <p>Nanjo doesn't <em>actually</em> say that Kanon died. All we really know is that there was a lot of blood everywhere and there was a bloody stake next to Kanon. <span class=blue-truth>Kanon did not die. If anyone believed that Kanon died, they were misled by Dr. Nanjo.</p>
    <h2>The mirror</h2>
    <p>In the prologue of episode 2, we see a mirror in a small shrine on a reef in sight of Rokkenjima and Niijima. We also see a mirror in Natsuhi's room. Perhaps one of these is purely symbolic... <span class=blue-truth>There is only one mirror. Somebody who didn't own it took it from Natsuhi's room and broke it.</span></p>
    <h2>Battler's promise</h2>
    <p>Battler broke a promise he made six years ago. Battler forgot someone six years ago. Somebody was heartbroken. "Both boys and girls... want to hear someone else say they love them first." There don't seem to be a lot of candidates, but six years ago Battler was 12 and Shannon was 10. "There are three ways to hurt a woman... the most effective way... It's to betray their hopes. No living being is more of a dreamer than a woman! They see their own dreams, and hurt themselves. A distant man like you hurts women the most! You couldn't understand. You don't have a clue how much you have injured Jessica."</p>
    <p>Perhaps <span class=blue-truth>six years ago, Battler was goofing about with Shannon and made some romantic promise to her that she took a <em>lot</em> more seriously than he did.</span> This would mean that it is Shannon "playing" Beatrice in episode 4.</p>
    <p>That said, I struggled to back this up. I thought some of the parts where we see Shannon talking to Beatrice about George might have been misrepresented to us, and actually be earlier in time and about Battler, but scouring them I couldn't quite see the evidence. It <em>is</em> suspicious that the mirror-breaking scene is so vague about who we are seeing.</p>
    <p>In addition, it seems that somebody plays Beatrice with Maria every year. This seems necessary to have some consensus on all the magic spells, unless Maria herself is painting every magic circle. They don't need to deceive Maria to achieve this because Maria is eager and willing to play along. We see in her other interactions and flashbacks that she is eager to play make-believe, and is offended when others decline to participate. The only people it seems could plausibly play the role of Beatrice every year are Shannon and Natsuhi. Perhaps this is the kernel of truth to extract from episode 5 Erika saying that Kinzo had Natsuhi play the part of Beatrice in a sex game... <em>somebody</em> was playing the part of Beatrice, but not necessarily Natsuhi and not necessarily as a sex game.</li>
    <h2>Battler's sin</h2>
    <p>Battler's sin is distinct from his promise. We know it has nothing to do with him and "Beatrice". We know it somehow enabled, triggered or snowballed into the events that led to the deaths on Rokkenjima. I don't know what it was.</p>
    <h2>Why did Shannon leave the Golden Land?</h2>
    <p>In episode 4, Shannon says she has been to the Golden Land, while Kanon clearly has any memory of having been there. In episode 2's prologue, probably-Shannon leaves the Golden Land by breaking the mirror, evoking both eating the fruit in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man">fall from Eden</a>, and making a contract with the sea witch in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>. The motivation there is to cease to be furniture. It's not clear if or how this can be interpreted in non-fantastical terms.</p>
    <p>There do seem to be hints that the heartbroken Beatrice (who might be Shannon?) made a deal rather like Ariel's sea-witch-contract with Lambdadelta. It feels like her hopes of Battler remembering his promise might be more than romance, but her last chance at meeting the terms of that deal?</p>
    <p>Can any of this be interpreted outside of fantasy? Perhaps, but I have no idea.</p>
    <h2>Battler's parentage</h2>
    <p>We are told that some unnamed servant fell off a cliff holding a baby and died. Who was that servant? Who was that baby?</p>
    <p>We are told that Kinzo showed the baby to Natsuhi, having brought it from the Fukuin orphanage.</p>
    <blockquote>"Accept this baby as my grandchild. And raise it to be the one who succeeds Krauss."</blockquote>
    <p>Note that not all the babies at the orphanage are <em>strictly</em> orphans.
    <blockquote>
        <p>All of the members of the Fukuin House were orphans.</p>
        <p>At least, they were all people who had been separated from their parents under special circumstances.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In a different story, Rosa accompanied Beatrice from Kuwadorian until she fell from a cliff and died. Is this describing the same event?</p>
    <p>We are told that Kyrie had a miscarriage and Asumu had a son, Battler. Indeed, <span class=red-truth>it was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born.</span> But Battler, despite confirming his own identity in red, is unable to say that he was born from Ushiromiya Asumu.</p>
    <p><span class=blue-truth>Asumu had a baby named Battler. That baby fell off a cliff and died. Kyrie also had a baby with Rudolph. By some means, that baby was raised as Battler by Rudolph and Asumu as their own child.</span> This explains why Battler cannot say that he was born of Asumu despite being able to say that Ushiromiya Battler was.</p>
    <p>Did Natsuhi get confused by Kinzo's request? Was Kinzo regularly shuffling babies around his family? What was anybody here trying to achieve? Why did Kyrie let Asumu raise her child as her own? Did Asumu know her own child had died?</p>
