    Well, I never did write up any final thoughts on Umineko. I'm not sure if I've missed the window there... I might still take a shot at it, if I can scrape together my ragged memories. But for today, let's talk about Higurashi episode 1. As ever, <em>there will be spoilers.</em>
    </p>
    <br><br><br><br><br>
    <p>
    I've just finished reading Episode 1 of Higurashi. (The terminology seems to be all over the place, but I'm calling the big chunks episodes and the small chunks chapter.) We met Keiichi, Rena, Mion, Satoko and Rika, as well as Tomitake and Ooishi. We had a nice introduction, everybody became friends, they went to the festival and then Bad Things Started To Happen.
    </p>
    <p>
    Having a bit more of a feel for this kind of story, I'm not sure I should try to "figure it out" but I think it's probably good to take note of what stood out to me, if only to give me something to mull over later when my memories fade.
    </p>
    <p>
    After everyone splits up and goes home on the night of the festival, nobody hears from Tomitake again. Detective Ooishi turns up at the school and tells Keiichi about his gruesome demise, enlisting Keiichi to gather information. It's unclear if Keiichi tells him anything useful. But something has changed. Maybe it was the events at the festival. Maybe it was Keiichi talking to Ooishi. Maybe it was Keiichi's shameful resolve to abandon the club rules and help Rena instead of striving solely to win. But from this point onward, Keiichi feels like an outsider, and begins to experience increasingly strange and threatening behaviour from Rena and Mion.
    </p>
    <p>
    At the same time, Keiichi starts to undergo a change of character himself. He talks about ideas occurring to him and feeling a great sense of relief at having a plan to protect himself, but these ideas seem to be alien to him. He is drawn to a metal baseball bat which he practices with aggressively, and we later learn from Rena that the "transferred" kid Satoshi behaved just the same.
    </p>
    <p>
    The way Ooishi seems distant, neutral and bound by rules feels significant. I feel like there's a mirroring between Ooishi and Oyashiro-sama, although I may be imagining some of that because I feel like I'm trying to construct a concept of Oyashiro-sama from scraps.
    </p>
    <p>
    At various times Keiichi becomes frozen in place while Rena or Mion take on a glassy-eyed and menacing visage, appearing to have inexplicable knowledge of his actions. We think they may be possessed. It's unclear whether they remember these events afterward. It does not seem a straightforward possession because they sometimes laugh cruelly about Keiichi even when this isn't happening. It's also unclear how reliable this account is. Keiichi seems like he may be an unreliable narrator, and may himself be possessed. It's possible he is inventing or imagining some or all of these interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
    When they are apparently possessed like this, they are not <em>just</em> trying to deliver a message. They definitely seem to need information from Keiichi. They seem to be trying to figure out what he told Ooishi. They seem to be trying to figure out if they are in danger from what he has disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is mentioned that Oyashiro-sama may curse those who leave Hinamizawa. Or some of those who leave. Or maybe those who enter? And that Oyashiro-sama may be understood to be some kind of guardian, trying to keep Hinamizawa partitioned... It's unclear whether this means protecting Hinamizawa from the outside world or the outside world from Hinamizawa.
    </p>
    <p>
    Keiichi becomes certain a number of times that some presence is clinging to his back. Towards the end of the episode he has multiple periods of complete amnesia, where we have evidence he was nevertheless conscious and active. (E.g. when Rena helped him back to his house, and immediately before he found himself in a room with dead bodies.) Perhaps he was possessed by this demon, the same demon making him behave like Satoshi before him?
    </p>
    <p>
    It was suggested that there is something more specific than just leaving Hinamizawa that triggers the curse. Perhaps it's leaving Hinamizawa with some object, or even with a demon? Maybe Keiichi and Rena unwittingly carried/smuggled a demon out of Hinamizawa and that caused their troubles? And Oyashiro-sama acts to clean up their mess? (Keiichi temporarily left Hinamizawa with Ooishi. I'm not sure if this preceeded his Satoshi-like thoughts.)
    </p>
    <p>
    There are five poorly-described adults seen outside Keiichi's house at the end. It seems like they may somehow be the adults who were previously demoned away? I'm actually really fuzzy on the story here. I think the demoned away people are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Potentially the dismembered foreman. I'm not really sure what parts of him were found and how they were affirmatively identified.</li>
        <li>The partner of the person who fell into a river? I can't remember this story at all. They supported the dam project? I think they were Satoko's parents??</li>
        <li>The wife of the shinto priest, imagined to have thrown herself into the swamp. (Rika's mother?)</li>
        <li>The child of the murdered housewife. Satoko's cousin?</li>
        <li>Satoshi, the student who "transferred out". Mion's brother???</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    I feel like something doesn't add up, though. It felt like we were being told that the mysterious strangers outside were all adults, but two of these demoned away people are mere children.
    </p>
    <p>
    I need to go back and check who was actually confirmed dead and who just disappeared, and to check the confirmed family relationships.
    </p>
    <p>
    During Keiichi's final phone call, Ooishi identified that he was in a phone booth because it was quiet. He later seemed to be surprised that he just noticed the call of cicadas. I <em>think</em> this is just providing some evidence that the booth was opened or broken into? I'm not really sure why it is significant, but it seems to be constructed like a clue.
    </p>
    <p>
    My gut feeling is that glassy-eyed Rena and Mion are channeling Oyashiro-sama, while whatever is happening to Keiichi is something else, since it feels like there's two or three factions acting against each other and trying to figure each other out.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'm not sure if Keiichi ever told Mion about the needle in the mochi explicitly. He thought he did, but he just talked about it as a cruel surprise. It's possible they were talking at cross-purposes. It's possible Mion really did just put Tabasco sauce in it.
    </p>
    <p>
    Okay so here's one possibility: Keiichi is plagued by a demon that is messing with him. Mion and Rena are aware of this or of this as a possibility, and have to be very circumspect to avoid telling the demon things that would help it. The demon is doing things like putting the needle into the mochi, or making Keiichi believe there was a needle, to isolate him and make him distrust his friends. It's also persuading him to get the bat and things like that. Or maybe Mion and Rena are not fully aware of this, but are being directed by Oyashiro-sama who is?
    </p>
    <p>
    Did Keiichi fuck up during the Watanagashi? Did the others? Were there rules he broke?
    </p>
    <p>
    Could Keiichi have killed Tomitake? There's strong circumstantial evidence he killed Mion and Rena. But then there's a strong parallel between the death of Tomitake and the apparent death of Keiichi, suggesting the same perpetrators. If Tomitake was killed for the same reason as Keiichi... perhaps we should look for evidence that Tomitake was under the same kinds of influences as Keiichi? Tomitake is one of the few people we know leaves Hinamizawa regurly. Could he also have done whatever it was we think Rena and Keiichi did?
    </p>
    <p>
    The description of Tomitake's corpse suggests he clawed his own throat out. This seems kinda implausible but maybe I guess?? There was a lot of very awkward description of evidence of contact with a wooden plank. I guess it's possible somebody went to a lot of bother to make it look like he clawed out his throat after the fact? I don't like this "drug that makes you claw your throat out" concept.
    </p>
    <p>
    We need to think about who removed something from the clock. We cannot assume that it was really a syringe, as Keiichi's account doesn't seem entirely reliable. It's also possible Keiichi removed it himself, possibly without retaining the memory, if he is possessed or otherwise has multiple identities fighting over his body.
