    <p>
    Well, I never quite got around to writing anything during episode 7 and already I'm tumbling into episode 8 without managing a whole lot of reflection. I really am an inconsistent reader and I feel like I've been a bit of an anchor on our group.
    </p>

    <p>
    As before, I'm not going to make any effort to avoid spoilers, so consider yourself warned. This is my fourth page of Umineko ramlbings. You may wish to review the <a href="blog-umineko.html">first</a>, <a href="blog-umineko-2.html">second</a> and <a href="blog-umineko-3.html">third</a>.
    </p>

    I really didn't like the earth-to-earth, illusions-to-illusions part, which felt like the worst kind of revelations, just bluntly telling us the nature of previous events with not even an attempt to recall them to memory. I feel like I <em>should</em> review them to make sense of prior events, but I am also just annoyed at Willard and at the story. It felt like the opposite of a story with love. Dry facts that reveal no meaning, answers without working.
    </p>

    <p>
    Nevertheless, I now have new revelations, a bunch of weird factoids and some very suggestive red scenes to fit into my jigsaw. I definitely made the call at the time that <span class=blue-truth>Kinzo's account of the deaths of the Japanese and Italian soldiers was deeply suspect</span>. After all, every other Beatrice is somebody's conspiracy, a story told to explain away events. Why not Beatrice Prime too?
    </p>

    <p>
    The other red scene, Genji cursing Dr Nanjo for saving his life... that was a surprise. I'd previously speculated that the unnamed servant who fell off a cliff might have been Genji's partner, in an attempt to explain why the Genji of today is a shell of his former Ronove-like self. But this suggests that it was Genji himself! But what is the nature of Genji's injury? Why can't his body love? <em>Is</em> this Genji talking? I can't help wonder if we have more body shennanigans going on. Maybe this scene shouldn't be interpreted on a mundane level... It does, after all, have echoes of Beatrice complaining of being bound into a human body by Kinzo's magic. But still, I think the most obvious interpretation is that <span class=blue-truth>Genji was the servant who fell off the cliff carrying a baby, Dr. Nanjo saved both their lives, and Genji suffered life-altering injuries.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Who is Kumasawa?</h2>

    <p>
    We know that Kumasawa and Virgilia are mirrors. We know that Virgilia was once called Beatrice and passed that name onto the child she looked after. Kumasawa is old enough to be ages with Kinzo. She works or doesn't at her own pleasure and it doesn't seem that anyone can really tell her what to do. Could it be that <span class=blue-truth>Kumasawa is the Beatrice Prime, the Italian Beatrice of Kinzo's story, who arrived on Rokkenjima in a submarine.</span> The game does love to tell us things plainly and then just pretend that it didn't.
    </p>

    <p>
    But this doesn't explain very much for us. We don't really see interactions between Kinzo and Kumasawa, but we know Kinzo feels abandoned by Beatrice. We are led to believe that Beatrice Prime died, just as did Beatrice the younger, the Beatrice Rosa saw fall from a cliff. But, as far as I can tell, we have not been told how she died. 
    </p>

    <p>
    We are told how Maria recognises people by their actions over their appearance. Perhaps Kinzo too has this affliction. He recognises Shannon as Beatrice when she solves the epitaph. Is it possible that Kinzo ceased to recognise his own Beatrice <em>without</em> her dying, simply by a change in her behaviour?
    </p>

    <p>
    I feel like I have puzzle pieces here that I am sure must go together, but they just don't quite fit the hole available.
    </p>

    <h2>What exactly is the nature of the Shannon illusion?</h2>

    <p>
    The Kinzo illusion was a conspiracy by Natsuhi, Krauss and a number of the servants to maintain the fiction that Kinzo was still alive, and Beatrice's magic was a metaphor for their work in doing so. The Shannon illusion appears to be a conspiracy to maintain that Shannon and Kanon are separate humans with separate bodies when in fact they only have one. It's unclear who else is involved in this fiction. It may be that <span class=blue-truth>Many of the adults only discover the truth that Shannon is Kanon is the Ushiromiya heir after she solves the epitaph and reveals this to them.</span> This might explain them playing along â€“ she has no desire for the gold and may have offered it to participate in a game.
    </p>

    <p>
    This, however, ignores the story we were <em>actually</em> told at the end of episode 7. We were told that Shannon fell into an inexplicable despondency when the adults found the gold. We're also told that she herself was willing to blow up the entire island, and appears to have been so willing in every other story. But we still have no idea what brought her to this point. She was disappointed that Battler forgot all about her, their shared fascination for mysteries and his promise to come take her away from this life. She was frustrated that she was raised alone and without family. But something very specific about Battler returning exactly at this time was exceptionally inopportune.
    </p>

    <p>
    Is it possible that she sought revenge on everyone <em>except</em> Battler and was distraught that he had stumbled into her trap? But she seemed to genuinely enjoy her time with Jessica and George. Was her time spent romancing them purely part of her plan to destroy the Ushiromiya family? This seems so wildly out of character. But then... neither Shannon nor Kanon are representative of those feelings. It is the persona of Beatrice that is murderous and cruel. Perhaps we never see those feelings specifically because she is so partitioned. 
    </p>

    <h2>How many toes does Genji have?</h2>

    <p>
    This is a silly one, but I can't help wondering if at some point, for some reason, Genji and Kinzo swapped places. We really don't know how Genji came into Kinzo's life, but we know they are very close, and they both seem similar ages. We know that Kinzo was just a puppet head, chosen from a branch family due to his webbed toes. I can't help but feel there's some opportunity or necessity for subterfuge here. But the thoughts aren't fully formed...
    </p>

    <h2>I'm tired</h2>

    <p>
    This thing is so sprawling. I don't have the energy to reread everything to make sense of it all, and even if I did my friends would rush on to the end without me. I've done my best to keep thinking all the way through, but for now I think the only way to move is onward.
