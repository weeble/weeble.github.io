    As I progress into episode 6, I'm realising there's a bunch of stuff I wish I'd recorded already, so this is an addendum to the <a href="blog-umineko.html">prior overview of my thoughts</a>.
    </p>
    <p><span class=red-truth>This is full of spoilers.</span> In addition to my own speculation, it describes things revealed in the game as late as about a third of the way into episode 6. You were warned.
    </p>

    <br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Games and rules</h2>

    <p>Many characters are presented as playing games against each other. It's hard to untangle them all. Kinzo and Beatrice. Battler and Beatrice. Kinzo and/or Beatrice against everyone else on the island. Some number of games between Bernkastel, Lambdadelta and Beatrice, which may or may not be resolved.</p>
    <p>Some of those participants may be multiple people. The names Beatrice and Beato, and the titles of golden and the endless witch all appear to be apply to different people at different times. Beatrice has multiple different appearances and even within one appearance still appears to be "played" by multiple different entities.</p>
    <p>The clearest and most recurring game is to make contested explanations for an observed series of events. There appears always to be a human side, attempting a mundane explanation of those events, bound by non-magical explanations, as well as some principle of reasonableness, encoded as Knox's rules. There appears always to be a magical side. But the magical side is not unrestrained. What is deeply unclear is what set of rules <em>they</em> must adhere to.</p>
    <p>It seemed in the early episodes that the magical circles mattered a lot, and that perhaps there was some rulebook for the magical side that we could not see, but might eventually be able to learn. But this side of things largely seemed to evaporate in later games, which the magical circles barely appearing at all. However, there seems to be more going on in that direction again now.</p>
    <p>It seems that <span class=blue-truth>each episode has two coherent explanations consistent with the red truths and observed by the detective.</span> The first explanation is the one we have been searching for, entirely mundane and with no need of witches. But the second, supernatural explanation must also exist, while meeting some set of rules we don't fully understand. Some of those rules might be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The humans are absolved of suspicion. The purpose of a magical explanation is to bring harmony. <span class=blue-truth>The humans can't be responsible for some of the murders under the witch's explanation.</span> We are led to believe this because of Battler's angst shown throughout episode 2, where he refused to suspect his family but also refused to accept the illusion of the witch. This seemed pointless unless it was to illuminate something about the world.</li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>The witch, nor any of her furniture, must not be seen by humans.</span> Perhaps with an exception for those that have accepted her existence already. It's unclear if the witch can vanish at will, as it seems like it's too easy to not be seen by humans by just vanishing the moment they get close.</li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>The witch must not open any door sealed by a magic charm.</span></li>
        <li>The witch is vulnerable to spider-webs.</li>
        <li>Mirrors have some power over the witch.</li>
        <li>The witch needs to use magic circles to perform certain effects.</li>
        <li>Magic circles need to be observed to have an effect. We were asked why the perpetrator painted scary magic circles, and concluded that they did not want to hide them, they wanted them to be seen. From the point of view of a mundane explanation, this was a challenge to explain when it seemed easier for the perpetrator to hide the existence of a crime at all. But from the magic point of view, we still have this question to address.</li>
        <li>Furniture can only do things that its master could do by themself... It's unclear how to interpret this constraint. The main place we've seen furniture with a specific power is in Gaap's use of portals. Does this mean that in order for Gaap to teleport things the witch must already have that power, perhaps through a magic circle? Or does it mean that the witch's furniture is purely decorative, and we should seek to explain things as is they weren't present?</li>
        <li>The deaths must be allocated to twilights.</li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>A stake must be impaled into each of those killed from the fourth to eight twilight.</span> However, it need not happen before death and it doesn't need to stay there until the body is found.</li>
        <li><span class=blue-truth>A stake can only be used on somebody guilty of the corresponding sin.</span> We must be able to find some evidence of that person's sin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We may say that this is all pointless. We have already been told how the witch did it. But we do not understand why the witch acted as she did. One must learn the constraints the witch is acting under to have any hope to craft a story, as we are told that people who have reached the truth are able to.</p>
    <h2>Sin</h2>
    <p>
        The game repeatedly presents us clues about one context by describing parallel events in another context. We must constantly scrutinise statements to see if they apply elsewhere.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Shannon: "...Nothing to be done about that. That's what you get for your cowardice before now."</p>
        <p>Kanon: "I know. That is my... sin."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Cowardice is a sin. Could this be Battler's sin? We are certainly getting a flood of clues now that what Battler forgot was his interactions with Shannon. We had hints before, such as on the beach in episode 3:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Jessica: "Shannon. By the way, what was Battler like six years ago? Remember any interesting episodes?"</p>
        <p>Shannon: "Let's see... I'm sure that he said something like this when he left. 'I'll be back, &lt;see you again&gt;. I'll surely come for you riding a white horse'."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Was Battler's promise romantic? It is implied to be, but this could also be taken as a more direct promise to rescue her? To help her to escape Rokkenjima? She has been there an unusually long time and it has been presented as her own choice, but is it actually so? Did she need somebody to help her? It is pretty fucked up that she has been working since the age of six.</p>
    <p>What other things are we told are sins?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shannon is cold to Kanon's words of comfort after being chastied by Natsuhi in the hall. She wishes someone else had come to comfort her. "That in itself...was a sin."</li>
        <li><em>Lack of</em> love is a sin. (I originally wrote here love is a sin, but it just seemed too improbable. I was misreading it as the original text is long and spans several ambiguously connected sentences.) "Love, the single element that makes up this world... When it is lacking, then your world is lacking too... It is the original sin that humans are founded upon and everything is made of."</li>
        <li>Rosa's sin is... well... everything. She neglected, beat and lied to her daughter. Her "great sin" is referred to a few times but it's not clear which of these actions in particular it was.</li>
        <li>Damaging the Ushiromiya family name by removing himself from the register was a sin. "Those six years during which you threw away the Ushiromiya family register were a significant period during which you covered the Ushiromiya family in mud. Know the depths of that sin." Perhaps should be understood to be breaking of the Christian commandment "Honour thy father and thy mother".</li>
        <li>Ange tells us that "Hitting someone with your hatred is nothing more than a sin. That isn't magic."</li>
        <li>Natsuhi failing to protect her family (from Krauss's terrible investments) is a sin. "However, this might also have meant that she had abandoned her duty, as a wife, to protect her family. The depths of this sin had been made quite clear to Natsuhi..."</li>
        <li>Natsuhi pushing a servant with a baby off a cliff was a sin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nineteen years ago</h2>
    <p>
        I'm still trying to make sense of what happened 19 years ago. A lot was going on. Somebody called Beatrice was living on Rokkenjima in Kuwadorian. Rosa saw her fall off a cliff and die. Kinzo presented a baby to Natsuhi. Asumu and Kyrie were at the end of their pregnancies. Rudolph and Asumu had recently gotten married. Natsuhi pushed somebody off a cliff while they were holding the baby Kinzo had presented to her.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm unclear on whether Natsuhi correctly interpreted Kinzo's intent in showing her the baby. She understood him to mean she should adopt the child to become Kinzo's grandchild. But it might be the case the child was already Kinzo's grandchild. But after an initial awkward interaction he does seem to explicitly tell her to raise the child.
    </p>
    <p>
    It's a real challenge to understand what is going on with the name Ushiromiya Battler. We have simultaneously that <span class=red-truth>It was from Ushiromiya Asumu that Ushiromiya Battler was born"</span>, that Beatrice's interlocutor says <span class=red-truth>"I am Ushiromiya Battler"</span> and that she tells him <span class=red-truth>"You are not Ushuromiya Asumu's son"</span>. If Battler is someone else's son, that still doesn't resolve the first statement. Other explanations are that Battler was born from Asumu but is not a son. This could mean being a daughter. Perhaps it could mean being adopted? When you are adopted, do you cease to be your birth parent's child? Alternatively we have the "two Battlers" explanation, though it's... strained. But we do need to figure out an identity for our mystery baby.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Beatrice in Kuwadorian is young and naive, like the Beatrice Battler creates. Battler's Beatrice calls him "father". This suggest to me that <span class=blue-truth>the Beatrice in Kuwadorian was Ushiromiya Kinzo's daughter</span>. This is reinforced by earlier speculation that the Beatrice arriving on the island in episode 2 might contest Kinzo's will, which can be seen as the game presenting us parallel facts to obscure the truth. It seems this Beatrice was taught by Kumasawa, who is represented at times by Virgilia.
