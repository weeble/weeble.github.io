    After the conclusion of episode 6, we have so much to think about! This is part three after my <a href="blog-umineko.html">first</a> and <a href="blog-umineko-2.html">second Umineko ramblings</a>. As before, <span class=red-truth>this page contains many spoilers</span>, both from observations of the first six episodes and from all my speculation, true or not.
    </p>

    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Episode 1, first twilight</h2>

    <p>Yes we're going back here again. I don't care. We're doing this until we nail it.</p>

    <p>Soooo, armed with our exciting new knowledge from episode 6, we have some fascinating observations here. There's so much that is never said! Just like we later observe that Nanjo carefully avoids saying that Kanon is dead, Hideyoshi here carefully avoids saying that Shannon is dead.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>George:</b> "...Is Shannon also, ...the same as, ...uncle Krauss and the others?"</p>
        <p><b>Hideyoshi:</b> "..."</p>

        <p>Hideyoshi deeply understood the meaning of those words. So he couldn't give George an answer. No, he thought that, to George right now, that was the only possible sincere and loving response. When George had asked whether she was the same, he had meant to ask whether her body was the same as the others.</p>
        <p>...Since Hideyoshi hadn't denied it, it meant that the body was just as horrible.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class=red-truth>Uncle Hideyoshi never said that Shannon was mutilated the same as the others.</span></p>

    <p>Of course, the narration then tells us that Hideyoshi sees Shannon's mutilated corpse, but we are already well aware that <span class=blue-truth>the narration will present fictions maintained by the characters as if they are reality, as long as they are not observed by the detective.</span></p>

    <p>Kanon has not been noted other than in the most vague terms of being present with the adults at the time the children first arrived, before Eva ran up to try to block their field of view. When Hideyoshi is inspecting Shannon's corpse, finally he is noted.</p>

    <blockquote>
        Trying his best to burn the image of the remaining half of Shannon's expression into his eyes, was Kanon. Kanon was not crying. Tears had risen to his eyes, but they did not drip down. But that didn't mean that he wasn't feeling as much sadness as everyone else.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Nowhere is it stated where Kanon is positioned or what he is doing. We are led to believe he is standing beside Hideyoshi and looking at Shannon's corpse. <span class=blue-truth>Kanon is lying on the floor.</span> This is not a description of Kanon observing Shannon's expression. This is a description of Kanon <em>assuming</em> Shannon's expression. It's unclear if the anguish Hideyoshi and Kanon experience is due to real deaths that have occurred around them (possibly at their own hands), or the pain of deceiving their loved ones.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>George:</b> "...I want you to look for me. On Shannon's finger... is there a ring...?"</p>
        <p><b>Hideyoshi:</b> "...A ring...? ...Let me see..."</p>
        <p>Hideyoshi crouched down</p>
        <p>...As he did, Kanon silently pointed to one of Shannon's hands.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class=blue-truth>Kanon is silent because he is playing the part of a corpse. He is showing Hideyoshi the ring on his own hand.</span></p>

    <p>So what I take from this is that <span class=blue-truth>Hideyoshi is colluding with Kanon to hide the fact that Shannon is not a dead body.</span> I can't figure out the nature of the collusion. Is one coercing the other? Are they cooperating? Is there a larger conspiracy?</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><b>Natsuhi:</b> "...Kanon. You too mustn't remain here any longer. Take the children and return to the mansion."</p>
        <p>Natsuhi, unable to take a step into the storehouse, had been standing under the rain the whole time. Maybe she had her own way of grieving, different from Battler's. She realized that she had to take on a sense of responsibility now that her husband was dead, so she gave Kanon those orders.</p>
        <p><b>Kanon:</b> "...Yes. Madam."</p>
        <p>Kanon rose silently, and turned to face her. His face was pure white, almost as though his own heart had died along with Shannon, there was no life in his expression. On an ordinary day, if he had been told to guide the children through the rose garden, Kanon would have led the way and guided them. But now, there was no distinction between Kanon and the children.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Although Kanon "rises" here, his position was never previously established. We assumed he was crouching by Shannon's corpse. But he could be getting up off the floor. The problem with this explanation is... what was the point of him lying on the floor? Why did he need to be there moments ago but can now get up and leave before the children have exited the scene?</p>

    <p>We must also grapple with the fact that we need a large conspiracy here. Hideyoshi is clearly aware that Shannon is not a dead body. Nanjo we must presume to be too, since he's not contradicting the claims that there are six dead bodies. Natsuhi seems to be aware too, but since for some reason she is unable to enter the storehouse it's possible she is not.</p>

    <p>It strikes me that this whole scene appears to be a performance. <span class=blue-truth>The purpose of the magic circle was to bring everyone here so that some of those present – including at least Kanon and Hideyoshi, but potentially also any or all of Nanjo, Eva, Natsuhi and Genji – could present a performance in front of an audience.</span> As we learned in episode 5, multiple people may be motivated to cooperate in a deception in order to preserve some shared secret. Could the identity of Shannon and Kanon be such a shared secret? Why would Hideyoshi of all people be motivated to preserve this secret? Is he trying to save George's feelings while helping Kanon to extricate himself from a messy situation?</p>

    <p>Are the others really dead at this point? I think we <em>have</em> to accept that at minimum Rudolph is dead, as Battler sees the corpse himself with terrible wounds. Although...</p>

    <blockquote>
        Anyways, the bodies which had been tumbled into here, each of them had been given an atrocious makeup.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Battler's first impression is that the gore is in fact makeup. There's always the possibility he is not wrong...</p>
